# Production Configuration for Outlier API Server
#
# This configuration is optimized for production deployments with:
# - File-based logging for persistence
# - JSON format for structured log aggregation
# - Restricted binding to localhost (use reverse proxy)
# - Standard HTTP port

[logging]
# Production log level (info is recommended)
level = "info"

# Log to file for persistence and rotation
output = "/var/log/outlier/outlier.log"

# JSON format for log aggregation tools (ELK, Splunk, etc.)
format = "json"

[server]
# Standard HTTP port (use reverse proxy for HTTPS)
port = 8080

# Bind to localhost only (nginx/caddy handles external traffic)
bind_ip = "127.0.0.1"
